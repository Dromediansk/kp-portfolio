His approach to development and QA, alongside his pragmatic view of reusability, stand above people with significantly more experience. On top of typical development tasks utilising JS, TS, HTML, CSS and AWS, he was actively involved in technical architecture processes where his input was valuable. I was sorry to see him move on from that project and the opening he left was difficult to fill. I would recommend Miro wholeheartedly and hope to work with him again in the future."

Miro's technical acumen places him in the upper echelons of developers I've had the pleasure to work with. His ability to merge high-level technical skills with real-world applications has been instrumental in driving our project forward. Miro's insights have been invaluable, contributing significantly to both my work and the project as a whole. Though his departure leaves big shoes to fill, his future team is incredibly lucky to have him. Wishing Miro all the best in his new endeavors – his impact here will be remembered."
